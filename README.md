LeNet-5 (LeCun et al., 1998) from scratch.  

Interesting facts about LeNet:  
- Progenitor of modern convolutional neural networks.
- Early development started in 1988 by Yann LeCun et al.
- First successful application of backpropagation in neural networks.
- LeNet-5 was the last and most well-known iteration.
- Widespread practical applications began in 1998.
- Recognised for recognising handwritten digits, especially U.S. postal ZIP codes.

Results:
- 0.94 test accuracy trained with [MNIST dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) (59400 training examples, 600 test examples).
- 10 epochs with 64 batch size and scheduled learning rate decay (0.001 for first 5 epochs, 0.0001 for last 5 epochs).
